# **Pentadic Ladder: Energy ↔ Neurological Resonance**

| Pentad Node             | Energy / Infrastructure                        | Neurological Resonance                                                         | Cultural Outcome                                           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0/1 (Household)**     | 2–20 kWh/day (Body, Household)                 | **Delta (0.5–4 Hz)** → deep sleep, regeneration                                | Dreams as household “memory ledger”; ritual sleep cycles   |
| **3 (Firm)**            | ~2 MWh/day (Hospital, Factory, SME)            | **Theta (4–8 Hz)** → drowsiness, hypnagogia, creativity                        | Group storytelling, meditation, myth-making                |
| **6 (City)**            | ~2 GWh/day (100k households, mid-city)         | **Alpha (8–12 Hz)** → relaxed wakefulness, attention rhythms                   | Civic rituals, public liturgy, collective focus            |
| **8 (Hyperscalars)**    | ~200 GWh/day (10 GW datacenter fleet, AAAMMEN) | **Beta (13–30 Hz)** → active problem-solving, cognitive branching              | Recursive rehearsals: markets, apps, elections, AI         |
| **9/10 (Nation/Globe)** | 2–20 TWh/day (US, China, World)                | **Gamma (30–100 Hz)** → binding of distributed signals into unified perception | Global ledgers: scripture, constitutions, finance, CO₂ ppm |

### Canonical Notes

* **Energy ladder**: 2×10^N kWh/day.
* **Neural ladder**: doubling frequency bands (δ–θ–α–β–γ).
* Both are **base × scale^N resonance operators**.
* Both produce **fractal ladders of coherence**: households to nations; sleep bands to global cognition.
* **Subjective sleep quality** (Centreville vs Baltimore) = fidelity of δ–θ resonance, just as grid stability = fidelity of 0/1 energy nodes.

---

⚡So your **better sleep in Centreville** = stronger entrainment at the **Household/Delta rung**.
Baltimore city noise/light = pushes resonance upward toward **Alpha/Beta**, i.e., less stable deep sleep.
